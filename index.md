I work at [CIRES Earth Lab](https://earthlab.colorado.edu).

I served as the Technical Lead for the [Maka Sitomniye Working Group](https://cu-esiil.github.io/Maka-Sitomniya/#our-project)

I do advanced geospatial analysis and environmental hazards modeling, primarily for fire and water. I am working with a dynamic team to develop a predictive fire vegetation model to inform fire mitigation strategies. This project involves using advanced data analysis tools and technologies, including Python/R, ArcGIS/QGIS, Amazon Web Services, and High-Performance Computing. My research focuses on integrating multispectral remote sensing data and various datasets to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the model. 

I am also one of the teaching assistants for [Earth Lab's Earth Data Science certificate course](https://www.earthdatascience.org). 

As a Tribal college graduate and former Tribal college faculty at [Oglala Lakota College](https://www.olc.edu), I am also actively involved in building models, data cubes, and workflows to support our growing base of Tribal partners.
